# Execute PowerShell Notebooks everywhere

Notebooks are good, but note used enough. It's time change that.

Check out the [presentation](PSCONFEU24_David_SASS_PowerShellNotebooks_Everywhere.pptx) and the sample notebooks in this folder.

Use the [PowerShell Notebook action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/powershell-notebook-action) to run them in your GitHub Actions workflows.

The sample notebooks and the two GitHub Actions workflows shown in the presentation are in [this repository](https://github.com/sassdawe/pwsh-notebook-tester)

Sample devcontainer configuration for better PowerShell Notebook editing experience is [here](https://github.com/sassdawe/pwsh-notebook-tester/blob/main/.devcontainer/devcontainer.json)
